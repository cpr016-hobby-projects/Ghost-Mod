# Ghost-Mod
## Tools Used: MCreator, Java
## Description:
I created a Minecraft mod to solve a problem on my modded Minecraft server. I wanted mobs to be difficult, but a decent house would prevent any mobs from entering, and I didn't want the mobs to destroy the house to get to the players. So I created ghosts.

I used MCreator as an IDE, but mostly edited Java files manually. For textures, audio, and the model, I took them from vanilla minecraft and made some changes. For the AI, I based it off of the Vex mob, with various changes to make it more dangerous.
